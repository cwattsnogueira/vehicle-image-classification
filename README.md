Vehicle Image Classification â€“ Deep Learning Capstone with TensorFlow & Keras

Project Overview

This capstone project applies deep learning techniques to classify vehicle images into two categories: Car and Bike. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the goal was to build a robust image classification pipeline that could later be extended to include environmental features such as location or time of day. The project builds on previous work in bike rental analysis and introduces computer vision as a new modality for predictive modeling.

Dataset Preparation

â€¢ 	Source: Manually curated image dataset split into train/ and validation/ folders.

â€¢ 	Structure:

â€¢ 	train/Car/ and train/Bike/

â€¢ 	validation/Car/ and validation/Bike/

â€¢ 	Cleaning:

â€¢ 	Removed non-JPG formats (e.g., WEBP, PNG) to ensure compatibility.

â€¢ 	Final counts:

â€¢ 	Bike (Train): 391 JPG images

â€¢ 	Car (Train): 399 JPG images

This manual curation ensured clean input for TensorFlowâ€™s image loader and reduced training errors.

Data Preprocessing
Used ImageDataGenerator for image loading and augmentation:

Training Generator

ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1./255,
    rotation_range=30,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    shear_range=0.1,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    fill_mode='nearest'
)

Validation Generator

ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)


â€¢ 	All images resized to 150Ã—150 pixels

â€¢ 	Batch size: 32

â€¢ 	Class mode: Binary (Car vs Bike)



Model Architecture

Built using TensorFlowâ€™s Keras API:

model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Input(shape=(150,150,3)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(16),
    BatchNormalization(),
    layers.ReLU(),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

â€¢ 	Input: RGB images (150Ã—150Ã—3)
â€¢ 	Flatten Layer: Converts image to 1D vector
â€¢ 	Dense Layer: 16 units with Batch Normalization and ReLU
â€¢ 	Output Layer: Sigmoid activation for binary classification

Compiled with:

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='binary_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy', tf.keras.metrics.Precision(), tf.keras.metrics.Recall()]
)


Model Training

â€¢ 	Epochs: 20 (early stopping after 5 stagnant epochs)

â€¢ 	Steps per epoch: Calculated manually from dataset size

â€¢ 	Callback: EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)



Training was conducted using .fit() with both training and validation generators.

Prediction Visualization
ample predictions on validation images:

| Prediction | Confidence | Actual Class | Result    |
|------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| Car        | 0.57       | Bike         | Incorrect |
| Car        | 0.72       | Car          | Correct   |
| Bike       | 0.05       | Bike         | Correct   |
| Car        | 0.97       | Car          | Correct   |
| Car        | 0.96       | Car          | Correct   |


These results suggest:

â€¢ 	The model tends to favor the "Car" class, even with low confidence.

â€¢ 	Misclassifications may stem from background cues or visual similarity (e.g., motorcycles).

â€¢ 	Feature extraction could be improved with convolutional layers.
